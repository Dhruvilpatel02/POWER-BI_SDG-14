# Power BI Report: SDG 14 - Shark Attack Analysis

## Overview
This report provides insights and visualizations based on the Power BI report **SDG 14 - Shark Attack Analysis**. It analyzes key metrics and trends related to shark attacks, focusing on seasonal trends, geographical distribution, and victim demographics.

## Key Findings
- **Seasonal Trends:** Shark attacks spike during warmer months, particularly in summer and fall, due to increased water activities.
- **Age Vulnerability:** Adults aged 21-50 are the most vulnerable, likely due to higher participation in activities like surfing and swimming.
- **Activity Risk:** Surfing and swimming pose the highest risk due to extended water exposure and distance from shore.
- **Unprovoked Attacks:** Most attacks occur without direct human interaction, highlighting natural shark behavior.
- **Geographical Impact:** Regions like American Samoa and New Smyrna Beach have the highest incidents, suggesting local activity patterns play a role.

## Report Sections
1. **Summary Dashboard**
   - Overview of key indicators related to shark attacks.
   - High-level trends and comparisons.

2. **Geographical Analysis**
   - Distribution of shark attacks across different regions.
   - Maps and heatmaps showing hotspots.
   - High-risk areas include Australia, South Africa, and the USA.

3. **Temporal Trends**
   - Shark attacks over time (yearly, monthly trends).
   - Seasonal peaks in summer and fall.
   - Historical trends indicate a rise in attacks, peaking in the early 2000s.

4. **Victim & Attack Analysis**
   - Types of shark attacks (provoked vs. unprovoked).
   - Males are more affected (83.1% of fatal cases).
   - The 11-30 age group is the most vulnerable.

5. **Recommendations**
   - **Enhanced Safety Measures:** Implement seasonal safety protocols in high-risk areas.
   - **Targeted Awareness:** Educate adults aged 21-50, particularly surfers and swimmers.
   - **Geographic Focus:** Increase monitoring and interventions in hotspots like American Samoa and New Smyrna Beach.
   - **Unprovoked Risk Mitigation:** Improve public safety interventions and monitoring in unprovoked attack zones.

## Conclusion
While shark attacks are frequent, fatal incidents are relatively low. Understanding seasonal patterns, geographical distribution, and activity risks can help in implementing better safety measures and awareness campaigns to reduce shark-related incidents.
